# EmbeddedPyston

## About
This repository holds an example of the [Pyston](https://github.com/pyston/pyston) interpreter embedded within a C++ program.

## Usage
This repository is available as a [GitHub template](https://github.com/MolassesLover/EmbeddedPyston/generate). The source is extremely modular, and lightweight, the only purpose it serves is kickstarting your project. You can just as easily use any other fork of Python, the example uses Pyston, since there aren't many C++ programs embedding it, from what I've seen on GitHub.
